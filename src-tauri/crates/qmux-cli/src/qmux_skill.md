# qmux

qmux is a terminal for coding and research agents. Its CLI controls the qmux session containing the caller. It returns a versioned JSON envelope so callers can use returned IDs instead of guessing them.

Before issuing a control command, verify that the caller is running in a qmux-managed pane:

```bash
test "${QMUX_ENV:-}" = 1
```

If that fails, say that this process is not running inside qmux and stop. Do not attempt to control a separately focused qmux window from outside its authenticated pane.

## Learn the installed CLI

The installed binary is the authority for syntax:

```bash
qmux --help
qmux workspace --help
qmux pane --help
qmux agent --help
qmux split --help
qmux artifact --help
```

Most public commands print one compact JSON object. Successful responses have `ok: true`, `apiVersion`, and `result`; server failures have `ok: false` and an `error` with a stable `code`, `message`, and optional `details`. Add `--human` for indented output. Parse IDs from responses rather than deriving them from titles or sidebar order.

## Understand caller authority

Every managed pane receives `QMUX_PANE_ID`, `QMUX_SOCK`, and an authenticated token. An interactive shell also receives a private user credential. Agent processes do not inherit that user credential.

This distinction is intentional:

- From a shell pane, the user CLI may inspect and change panes, splits, and agents in its current workspace.
- From an agent pane, reads are limited to the caller and its live descendants. Agent mutations are limited to explicitly supported lifecycle operations, such as starting a child, prompting or releasing a direct child, and forking itself.
- Raw pane writes, focus changes, workspace mutations, and split mutations require the interactive user credential.

If an operation is denied from an agent pane, do not search the environment for a stronger credential. Report the restriction or ask the user to run it from an interactive shell pane.

## Discover context and state

Start with the caller context, then list before targeting opaque IDs:

```bash
qmux context
qmux workspace list
qmux pane list
qmux pane current
qmux agent list
qmux artifact list
qmux split list
```

Use `workspace get <id>`, `pane get <id>`, and `agent get <id>` for individual records. `pane current` intentionally follows `pane list` in the command surface and resolves from the caller credential, not UI focus.

Read terminal output with:

```bash
qmux pane read <pane-id> --source terminal --lines 120
qmux pane read <pane-id> --source viewport
```

`terminal` reads sanitized scrollback and is the default. `viewport` reads the currently rendered native terminal. Agent reads default to structured transcript turns:

```bash
qmux agent read <agent-id> --source transcript --turns 4
qmux agent read <agent-id> --source terminal --lines 120
```

CLI reads never change user focus.

## Run ordinary terminal work

Create a background shell pane in the current workspace, optionally preserving an explicit working directory:

```bash
qmux pane create --current-workspace --cwd "$PWD" --no-focus
```

Read the pane ID from `.result.pane.id`, then send text or atomically submit a command:

```bash
qmux pane send <pane-id> "text without Enter"
qmux pane send <pane-id> "text with Enter" --submit
qmux pane run <pane-id> "just test"
```

Wait for output already present or produced later. Exactly one matcher is required; timeouts accept `ms`, `s`, or `m` and default to seconds when no suffix is present:

```bash
qmux pane wait-output <pane-id> --match "test result" --timeout 2m
qmux pane wait-output <pane-id> --regex "tests? passed" --timeout 120s
```

The wait searches bounded sanitized scrollback immediately and returns a recent output tail. A timeout is a normal JSON result with `complete: false` and `timedOut: true`.

Rename, focus, or close only panes the user intended to change:

```bash
qmux pane rename <pane-id> "tests"
qmux pane focus <pane-id>
qmux pane close <pane-id>
```

Prefer background creation. Do not close panes you did not create unless the user explicitly asked.

## Start and coordinate agents

Start a supported adapter in the current workspace. An optional leading name becomes the pane title; the returned agent ID remains the authoritative target:

```bash
qmux agent start reviewer --adapter codex --prompt "Review the current diff." --worktree --effort high --no-focus
```

Available launch options are `--adapter`, `--prompt`, `--worktree`/`-w`, `--model`, `--effort`, and `--cwd`. Do not request a worktree or different cwd unless the task needs isolation or the user asked for it.

Coordinate the returned agent with:

```bash
qmux agent prompt <agent-id> "Report only actionable findings."
qmux agent wait <agent-id> --until settled --timeout 2m
qmux agent read <agent-id> --source transcript --turns 6
```

Wait states are `settled`, `input`, `permission`, `done`, `failed`, and `exited`. `--until done` completes when an agent finishes or fails; inspect the returned `agent.status` to distinguish success from failure. Inspect `agent get` and `agent read` after a timeout or a request for input before choosing the next action.

Fork an existing live agent, optionally with a launch prompt and isolated worktree:

```bash
qmux agent fork <agent-id> --prompt "Try the alternative approach." --worktree --no-focus
```

Use `qmux agent focus <agent-id>` only when the user wants to switch context. Release a live agent only after its work is no longer needed:

```bash
qmux agent release <agent-id>
```

Release refuses to close an agent that still has live descendants. Handle `blockedByLiveDescendants` by coordinating or releasing those descendants first; do not bypass the lineage check with raw pane closure.

## Manage split layout

Splits contain adjacent panes in one workspace. Inspect the existing layout before changing it:

```bash
qmux split list
qmux split join <pane-id> <adjacent-pane-id>
qmux split resize <split-id> <pane-id> 0.6
qmux split leave <pane-id>
```

`resize` sets that pane's absolute fraction and proportionally redistributes the remainder. Fractions preserve a minimum usable size for every member. Split changes are persisted and applied to the live UI.

## Workspaces and artifacts

Shell callers can create a workspace or rename their current one:

```bash
qmux workspace create --name "review" --dir "$PWD"
qmux workspace rename <current-workspace-id> "new name"
```

Artifacts are files or loopback URLs previously recorded by qmux agents. List them, then request one in qmux's browser overlay:

```bash
qmux artifact list
qmux artifact open <artifact-id>
```

Artifact paths remain confined to the owning pane's allowed file roots, and URLs must be loopback HTTP(S).

## Safety rules

- Verify `QMUX_ENV=1` before control commands.
- Use IDs from JSON responses and caller context; never infer a target from UI order.
- Prefer `--no-focus` for background work and use focus commands only on request.
- Inspect before prompting, writing, releasing, closing, or rearranging existing work.
- Never expose or copy `QMUX_TOKEN` or `QMUX_USER_TOKEN`.
- Do not try to turn an agent token into a user credential.
- Server errors exit with status 1. CLI syntax errors exit with status 2.
